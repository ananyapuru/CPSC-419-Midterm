Hi!
There was no specified behaviour for what the `Next` button should do with regards to the automatic slideshow when it is clicked right after the previous button, i.e. I wasn't sure if the automatic slideshow should resume by default or if I should give the user the option to resume it by clicking on the pause button (which now reads `Resume` since the previous button was clicked earlier). 

I therefore just chose one method to implement and let the user choose if they want to resume the slideshow or not. I hope this is okay! Thank you for your understanding.
